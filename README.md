# LeetCode Solutions

My daily LeetCode practice as I strengthen my data structures and algorithms skills.

## About

I'm working through LeetCode problems to prepare for technical interviews, focusing on building pattern recognition and problem-solving intuition.

## Organization

Solutions are organized by pattern, then by difficulty:
```
leetcode/
├── arrays/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
├── hashmaps/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
├── stacks/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
└── two-pointers/
    ├── easy/
    ├── medium/
    └── hard/
```

## Progress

Tracking my journey as I build consistency and deepen my understanding of common algorithmic patterns.
